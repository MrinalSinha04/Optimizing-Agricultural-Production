### Optimizing-Agricultural-Production
##### This projects helps to predict the crops which are reqiured to been grown for good Agricultural Production under given climatics and soil conditions such as level of Nitrogen , Phosphorus , Potassium and PH value of the soil and temperature , humidity and Rainfall of the place. 
#### The model has an accuracy of 97% which could help Agricultural sector in postive manner.
##### This model uses Data Science librares like pandas , numpy , seaborn and MatPlotLib.
##### Machine Learning Algorithm Like Clustering, Predictive Modeling, Descriptive Statistics, Hard Clustering , Data Visualization, Univariet, Bivariet and Multivariet Analysis is taken into taken into considertion whie biliding the model.
##### Model Realtime Prediction is also done.
