### Optimizing-Agricultural-Production
##### Require Jupyter-Notebook with python 
##### This projects helps to predict the crops which are reqiured to been grown for good Agricultural Production under given climatics and soil conditions such as level of Nitrogen , Phosphorus , Potassium and PH value of the soil and temperature , humidity and Rainfall of the place. 
#### The model has an accuracy of 97% which could help Agricultural sector in postive manner.
##### The model uses Data Science librares like pandas , numpy , seaborn and MatPlotLib.
##### Machine Learning Algorithm Like Clustering ,Predictive Modeling and Descriptive Statistics.
##### Model Realtime Prediction is also done.
